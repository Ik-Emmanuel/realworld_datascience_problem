## Project Description
This project was carried out to answer business questions about a group of sales data. 
The data used , was a bunch of 12 different CSV sales data showing sales for 12 months in 2019. 
These files were stored in different locations and had to be merged to perfom our business analysis. 

## Project Aim
Here I tried to explore the data to pull various insights such as: 
> what month had the highest sale?.  
> what product sold the most?.  
> what was the best time to dive ads?
> what 2 or more product were frequently sold together?
 
 
 ## Tools 
 
 * I worked with the jupyter notebook under the anaconda package using python 3.6.  
 * The dataset "Sale.CSV" was the csv file containing the data
